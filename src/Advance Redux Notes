TYPES OF ACTIONS

EVENTS
	-> notifies a change in the app
COMMANDS
	-> invoking queries or procedures
DOCUMENTS
	-> contains or transfering data

TIPS:
	* It's okay to dispatch an action without invoking a procedure
	* Write more code that what you're actually writing
	* A good code is no code, but a better code must be human readable
	* You decide on what your code is going to be
